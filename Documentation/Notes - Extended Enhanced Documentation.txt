a file in \auto_flash with a .bin extension will be flashed on the boot.  After the flash the file will be changed to *.bin.X where X represents the a number from 1...onward depending on how many files are in the directory.  Then a reboot will occur
After an auto_flash the password will have been reset and it will be necessary to put a new set of passwords in.  Also, after the flash the install of the LB code will have been undone.  This means that you will have to change the \install\auto_package_done to \install\auto_package for it to work through re-installation
The re-install of LB code after the auto_flash could be scripted in the run-on-boot.sh

During LB install lights will be:
	WiFi LED which will blink on/off. - Start of extendRoot init
	WiFi LED solid - End of extendRoot init
	USB LED which will blink on/off - Start of LB package installation
	USB LED solid - End of LB package installation
	
A single blinking USB LED (without Solid WiFi LED) indicates - Box Installer Failure ------  after a failed LB install



syslog_recv.py is a simple script for a client computer, collecting installation log iinformation.  The client has to be connected via a wired and fixed IP of 192.168.1.2:9999

USB Stick /install		Contains:
	/auto_package		One or more lined files with the packages needed to be installed.  This file is renamed after installation to auto_package_done to keep it from re-installing
	/OpenWRT.img.gz		(prepared ext3-image file
	/<packageimg>		Stuff that is needed by Library Box install  file: 'librarybox_Rev.Sub_img.tar.gz'
	/cache				Folder containing all needed .ipk files
	/Package.gz_main	Package-List from public repository
	/Package.gz_piratebox	(Optional) Package-List from PirateBox repository
	
USB Stick /auto_flash	(Optional) Contains:
	<image>.bin			An image in this folder which is flashed with sysupgrade during bootup.  Sysupgrade makes some firmware compatibility checks before reflashing
						After flashing or if there are incompatibilities the file gets renamed 

USB Stick /stop.txt		(Optional) if this file is present the auto_package file won't be processed during boot

USB Stick /auto_flash	(Optional) Contains:
						.bin files that will be flashed automatically during the next boot.  If it fits to the device.  This will happen before auto_package is processed.
						Flashed images will be renamed and flashed from the ram (not directly from USB)
						
USB Stick /run-on-boot.sh (Optional)
	look for an install_h5ai.sh and execute it if found.  After execution it will rename install_h5ai.sh to install_h5ai.sh.done
		Requires having h5ai_installer.tar also present
	look for file /Content_Update/install.txt and if found will copy all files/directories in USB Stick /Content_Update to the USB Stick /LibraryBox/Contnet directory then rename the
		/Content_Update/install.txt  to /Content_Update/done.txt
	After completion of any action it will reboot the unit


Boot sequence process:
0. Boot the firmware image on the unit & mount the USB drive if it is present

1. Check if the architecture is supported by auto flash tool and a image file is available.
1.1. If yes, try to identify the model.
1.2. If image foud, rename the image file with an incremented number (of existing files. That it won't be
redetected again.
1.3. Create a copy into /tmp and execute sysupgrade on it. (and do a reboot)

2. If stop.txt exists, stop here. (create a log entry)

3. If extendRoot filesystem wasn't enabled,
3.1. start logging
3.2. Run box_installer script for extendRoot initialization.
3.3. Copy over logfile

4. If auto_package install file is there
4.1. run automatic package install
4.2. move installed packages out of auto_package to auto_package_done
4.3. if that was the last line, remove auto_package file
4.4. trigger a reboot

Special files:
files/bin/box_installer.sh		- Script doing the work, loggs to sTDOUT and STDERR
files/bin/box_installer_start.sh- Script launching syslog daemon and rerouts installer output to syslog-daemon
files/bin/box_init_setup.sh		- Script for a simple user menu setting time, root password, FTP password & DNLA options
